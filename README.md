####First law of thermodynamics

"The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but cannot be created or destroyed."

- Every piece, every particle of you and me now was a part of something else before, and will be a part of something else in the future. There's something profoundly beautiful about that - you are just a being that can into existence by chance or by some event occuring, and every part of you is borrowed or existed somewhere else before. During your life your particles are exchanged by you drinking things, and as your skin sheds. After your death you purely become a part of something else - you are turned into something completely new, broken up into pieces, and you truly become new. 

####History

History never remembers things that don't happen. Examples could be things that someone sacrifies themselves to stop - we never rememmber these individuals.
